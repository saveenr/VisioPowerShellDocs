# Introduction

The **Visio PowerShell** module - **VisioPS** - automates and simplifies common tasks for Visio 2010 and later versions. VisioPS **feels natural for PowerShell users** because it maps standard PowerShell verbs and idioms to Visio concepts.

**See it in action** - watch this video for a demonstration: [**https://vimeo.com/94408016**](https://vimeo.com/94408016) \(The video covers an older version - but the principles are the same\)

VisioPS is open source under the MIT license. Visit the [**VisioAutomation GitHub repo**](https://github.com/saveenr/VisioAutomation).
