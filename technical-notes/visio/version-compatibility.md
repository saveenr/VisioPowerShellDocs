# Visio version compatibility

#### Visio versions <a id="visio-versions"></a>

This module works with any versions of from Visio 2010 and later

#### Visio 64-bit vs 32-bit <a id="visio-64-bit-vs-32-bit"></a>

Because VisioPS is developed against the Visio 2010 \(32 bit\) it doesn't have support for any features unique to later versions of Visio and can't be used with any 64 bit version.
